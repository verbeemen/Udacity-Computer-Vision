    "\n",
    "In this step of the notebook, you will customize the training of your CNN-RNN model by specifying hyperparameters and setting other options that are important to the training procedure.  The values you set now will be used when training your model in **Step 2** below.\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    " The model which I used exist out of 2 parts, an encoder and a decoder.  \n",
    "   \n",
    " *Encoder*: The Encoder consists of a pre-trained model, namely ResNet-50 where the last layer is removed.  \n",
    "ResNet-50 is a large CNN which contains 50 layers. The original task of ResNet-50 was to classify more than 1000 objects. But by replacing the last layer (softmax) with our own fully connected layer it allows us to use the insights of the entire model on our new applications.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "*Decoder*: The decoder converts the given captions into Embeddings. Then the decoder merges the features of the encoder together with the embeddings. \n",
    "This new vector will be used as an input for our single layer of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).\n",
    "Finally, a fully connected layer (with the size of our vocabulary) tries to predict the next word or words.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The Encoder tries to capture useful objects in an image. The Decoder tries to generate an useful text given the knowledge of the encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    " - I think that there is no real need to change it ... the dataset contains out of 414.113 samples (which is already quit large). And the existing augmentation techniques are the most important ones (RandomCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip). Maybe i could alter the pixel brightness as well (or turn some pixels off).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "- *Batch-Size* : 64, I tried different batch-sizes (32, 64, 128, 512) and 64 worked out best for me.  \n",
    "  (I gave each batch-size some amount of time (x-amount of training steps) (see image)).  \n",
    "   \n",
    " - *Vocab threshold*: 5, (used by the paper and also in previouse exercises)   \n",
    " - *Embedding size*: 512 (used by the paper)  \n",
    " - *Hidden size*: 512 (used by the paper)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "*Note:* The larger the embedding size and hidden sizes are, the more complex patterns they are able to learn. However if you pick a number which is to large, you might risk to overfit the model. Nevertheless the main reason why I went at the end for 5, 512, 512 was because of the fact that the paper also used these parameters, otherwise i would have taken a sligthly smaller model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "- *ADAM*: The ADAM optimizer is one of the better optimizers that can find a minimum quite quickly. Beside that, its default settings do work often very well out of the box. And thanks to the adaptive learning rate (and momentum) we know that it doesn't get stuck that quickly in a local minimum. (Yes, you can play with other optimizers and change the LR etc. But eventually you've to choose, especially when 1 epoch takes 2-3 hours?) "

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
