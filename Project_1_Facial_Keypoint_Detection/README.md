# Project Overview  
In this small project, I tried to build a facial keypoint detection system.   
As an input, I use an image with a face, and try to predict the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints (on the faces)!  
  
The Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications.  
These applications include: 
 - facial tracking, 
 - facial pose recognition, 
 - facial filters,
 - and emotion recognition.
